we split the message into blocks of 512bits (in our case 64 chars)

full blocks of 64 chars get added as such to the linked list until we have less than 64 chars left.
if the remaining string is 55 < len < 64 then we put the text in the block and append the separator in the following block we put the lenght of the original message in the trailing 8 chars
if the remaining string is len < 56 then we put the text in the block and append the separator and put the length in the trailing 8 chars.

in its last block, the last 8 bits are reserved for the length in bits of the original message.

8 | 8
8 | 8
8 | 8
8 | > 8 < the length in bits of the original message

and after the last written character in our block we put a separator 0b1000 0000
